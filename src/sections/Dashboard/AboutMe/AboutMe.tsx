        <p>
          I'm <strong>Stuart</strong> â€” a romantic builder weaving love letters in Solana's blockchain cathedral, 
          where every smart contract whispers sweet promises of decentralization.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion burns bright for <strong>DeFi symphonies</strong>, on-chain poetry, and crafting protocols 
          that users can trust like old lovers â€” faithful, transparent, and eternally devoted.
        </p>

        <SectionHeading $theme={currentTheme}>Vision & Mission</SectionHeading>
        <p>
          Creator of this casino platform and the sacred <strong>$DGHRT token</strong>, my mission dances 
          like candlelight against cathedral walls: fuse secure blockchain artistry with fun, fair entertainment 
          that feels like a slow-burn serenade.
        </p>
        <p>
          I craft systems that are <em>verifiably fair</em>, <em>non-custodial as moonlight</em>, 
          and <em>community-centric as a love song</em> â€” where every transaction tells a story of trust.
        </p>

        <SectionHeading $theme={currentTheme}>Life On & Off the Chain</SectionHeading>
        <p>
          By day, I chase <strong>AI ghosts</strong> through neural networks. By night, I dance in <strong>AR/VR dreams</strong> 
          where pixels become poetry. I'm a full-stack storm chaser, backend thumper, frontend dreamweaver, 
          and DevOps alchemist brewing magic in cloud cathedrals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Off-duty? I'm deep in <em>memecoin moonbeams</em>, building for the thrill of watching code come alive. 
          Building isn't just my craft â€” <strong>it's my love language</strong>, whispered in commit messages 
          and sung through deployment pipelines.
        </p>

        <SectionHeading $theme={currentTheme}>Connect & Collaborate</SectionHeading>

          Thank you for being here, fellow traveler of the digital cathedral. 
          Let's build something unforgettable together â€” where every line of code 
          is a love letter to the future. ðŸš€ðŸ’•
