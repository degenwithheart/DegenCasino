# üÉè Poker Showdown

Strategic multiplayer poker game where players select their drawing strategies before the game begins, then watch their predetermined decisions play out in a single Gamba transaction.

## üéÆ Game Concept

**Poker Showdown** is a unique take on multiplayer poker that respects Gamba's one-transaction rule while maintaining strategic depth. Players choose their card-drawing strategy before the game starts, then all outcomes are determined deterministically in a single transaction.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **GameLobby.tsx** - Main lobby for joining/creating games
- **StrategySelection.tsx** - Pre-game strategy selection interface
- **GameScreen.tsx** - Animated game results display with poker table

- **GameEngine.ts** - Executes complete games deterministically

### Key Features
