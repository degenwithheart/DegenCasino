# ✅ Poker Showdown - Complete Gamba Portal Integration

## 🎯 What Was Updated

The Poker Showdown game has been **completely integrated with Gamba's portal system**, following the exact patterns used by other games in the casino. All components now properly use the three-portal architecture.

## 🔧 Portal Integration Structure

### **Three-Portal System Implementation**

Every game component now follows this structure:
```tsx
return (
  <>
    {/* Stats Portal - Game statistics and info header */}
    <GambaUi.Portal target="stats">
      <GameStatsHeader {...} />
    </GambaUi.Portal>

    {/* Screen Portal - Main game content */}
    <GambaUi.Portal target="screen">
      <GameContainer>
        {/* All game UI content */}
      </GameContainer>
    </GambaUi.Portal>

    {/* Controls Portal - Wager inputs and action buttons */}
    <GambaUi.Portal target="controls">
      <MobileControls {...} />
      <DesktopControls {...} />
    </GambaUi.Portal>
  </>
)
```

  background: ...;
`
